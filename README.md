# Option-Writing
Uses Interactive Brokers native python api framework, build 9.73

Selling options intraday on liquid underlyings like BABA, FB, AAPL, etc.
This was initially done with naked options, but due to margin restrictions, it had to be implemented with credit spreads.

I've automated the execution of this strategy, but it is difficult to get options data and run checks for more than a few underlyings in a 
timely enough fashion, since strikes must be requested in individual slices.

main.py, operations.py, and tools.py are the system files.

native_api_multithreaded.py is an example of how data can be retrieved more quickly with threading and concurrent programming. This is a framework for a work around for the speed problem, but causes data pacing violations and requires paying for more market data

The dataset in the included csv file displays recorded results for roughly 6 months of trading. 

naked_options_writing_analysis.py looks at features from the dataset, finds their median, and asseses the win rates for trades above and below. Various bits of infortmation can be extrapolated from this. As an example, the win rates for trades with relatively higher vega and lower gamma tend to be higher. Decreasing vega is beneficial to this strategy, and since vega typically regresses as strikes move farther in the money, it makes sense to sell vega that is already relatively higher. Lower gamma implies less sensistivity in the options price, so perhaps hunting for lower instances is making it more difficult for the stop loss to get hit.

naked_options_writing_expectancy.py attempts to understand future results by looking at average risk/reward, win rate, and number of trades in a given time frame.
